def roll(a, shift, axis=None):
    """
    Roll tensor elements along a given axis.

    Elements that roll beyond the last position are re-introduced at
    the first.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input tensor.
    shift : int or tuple of ints
        The number of places by which elements are shifted.  If a tuple,
        then `axis` must be a tuple of the same size, and each of the
        given axes is shifted by the corresponding number.  If an int
        while `axis` is a tuple of ints, then the same value is used for
        all given axes.
    axis : int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which elements are shifted.  By default, the
        tensor is flattened before shifting, after which the original
        shape is restored.

    Returns
    -------
    res : Tensor
        Output tensor, with the same shape as `a`.

    See Also
    --------
    rollaxis : Roll the specified axis backwards, until it lies in a
               given position.

    Notes
    -----

    Supports rolling over multiple dimensions simultaneously.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import mars.tensor as mt

    >>> x = mt.arange(10)
    >>> mt.roll(x, 2).execute()
    array([8, 9, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])

    >>> x2 = mt.reshape(x, (2,5))
    >>> x2.execute()
    array([[0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
           [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]])
    >>> mt.roll(x2, 1).execute()
    array([[9, 0, 1, 2, 3],
           [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]])
    >>> mt.roll(x2, 1, axis=0).execute()
    array([[5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
           [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]])
    >>> mt.roll(x2, 1, axis=1).execute()
    array([[4, 0, 1, 2, 3],
           [9, 5, 6, 7, 8]])
