def atleast_3d(*tensors):
    """
    View inputs as tensors with at least three dimensions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tensors1, tensors2, ... : array_like
        One or more tensor-like sequences.  Non-tensor inputs are converted to
        tensors.  Tensors that already have three or more dimensions are
        preserved.

    Returns
    -------
    res1, res2, ... : Tensor
        A tensor, or list of tensors, each with ``a.ndim >= 3``.  Copies are
        avoided where possible, and views with three or more dimensions are
        returned.  For example, a 1-D tensor of shape ``(N,)`` becomes a view
        of shape ``(1, N, 1)``, and a 2-D tensor of shape ``(M, N)`` becomes a
        view of shape ``(M, N, 1)``.
