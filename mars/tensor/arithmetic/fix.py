    Round to nearest integer towards zero.

    Round a tensor of floats element-wise to nearest integer towards zero.
    The rounded values are returned as floats.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x   : array_like
        An tensor of floats to be rounded
    out : Tensor, optional
        Output tensor

    Returns
    -------
    out : Tensor of floats
        The array of rounded numbers

    See Also
    --------
    trunc, floor, ceil
    around : Round to given number of decimals

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import mars.tensor as mt

    >>> mt.fix(3.14).execute()
    3.0
    >>> mt.fix(3).execute()
    3.0
    >>> mt.fix([2.1, 2.9, -2.1, -2.9]).execute()
    array([ 2.,  2., -2., -2.])
