def expm1(x, out=None, where=None, **kwargs):

    Calculate ``exp(x) - 1`` for all elements in the tensor.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
       Input values.
    out : Tensor, None, or tuple of Tensor and None, optional
        A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
        a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or `None`,
        a freshly-allocated tensor is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
        keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
    where : array_like, optional
        Values of True indicate to calculate the ufunc at that position, values
        of False indicate to leave the value in the output alone.
    **kwargs

    Returns
    -------
    out : Tensor
        Element-wise exponential minus one: ``out = exp(x) - 1``.

    See Also
    --------
    log1p : ``log(1 + x)``, the inverse of expm1.


    Notes
    -----
    This function provides greater precision than ``exp(x) - 1``
    for small values of ``x``.

    Examples
    --------
    The true value of ``exp(1e-10) - 1`` is ``1.00000000005e-10`` to
    about 32 significant digits. This example shows the superiority of
    expm1 in this case.

    >>> mt.expm1(1e-10).execute()
    1.00000000005e-10
    >>> (mt.exp(1e-10) - 1).execute()
    1.000000082740371e-10
