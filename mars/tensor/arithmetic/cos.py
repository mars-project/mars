    Cosine element-wise.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input tensor in radians.
    out : Tensor, None, or tuple of Tensor and None, optional
        A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
        a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or `None`,
        a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
        keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
    where : array_like, optional
        Values of True indicate to calculate the ufunc at that position, values
        of False indicate to leave the value in the output alone.
    **kwargs

    Returns
    -------
    y : Tensor
        The corresponding cosine values.

    Notes
    -----
    If `out` is provided, the function writes the result into it,
    and returns a reference to `out`.  (See Examples)
