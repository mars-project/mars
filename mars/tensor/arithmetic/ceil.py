def ceil(x, out=None, where=None, **kwargs):
    r"""
    Return the ceiling of the input, element-wise.

    The ceil of the scalar `x` is the smallest integer `i`, such that
    `i >= x`.  It is often denoted as :math:`\lceil x \rceil`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input data.
    out : Tensor, None, or tuple of Tensor and None, optional
        A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
        a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or `None`,
        a freshly-allocated tensor is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
        keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
    where : array_like, optional
        Values of True indicate to calculate the ufunc at that position, values
        of False indicate to leave the value in the output alone.
    **kwargs

    Returns
    -------
    y : Tensor or scalar
        The ceiling of each element in `x`, with `float` dtype.

    --------
    floor, trunc, rint

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import mars.tensor as mt

    >>> a = mt.array([-1.7, -1.5, -0.2, 0.2, 1.5, 1.7, 2.0])
    >>> mt.ceil(a).execute()
    array([-1., -1., -0.,  1.,  2.,  2.,  2.])
