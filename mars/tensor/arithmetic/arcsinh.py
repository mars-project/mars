    Inverse hyperbolic sine element-wise.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input tensor.
    out : Tensor, None, or tuple of Tensor and None, optional
        A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
        a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or `None`,
        a freshly-allocated tensor is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
        keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
    where : array_like, optional
        Values of True indicate to calculate the ufunc at that position, values
        of False indicate to leave the value in the output alone.
    **kwargs

    Returns
    -------
    out : Tensor
        Tensor of of the same shape as `x`.

    Notes
    -----
    `arcsinh` is a multivalued function: for each `x` there are infinitely
    many numbers `z` such that `sinh(z) = x`. The convention is to return the
    `z` whose imaginary part lies in `[-pi/2, pi/2]`.

    For real-valued input data types, `arcsinh` always returns real output.
    For each value that cannot be expressed as a real number or infinity, it
    returns ``nan`` and sets the `invalid` floating point error flag.

    For complex-valued input, `arccos` is a complex analytical function that
    has branch cuts `[1j, infj]` and `[-1j, -infj]` and is continuous from
    the right on the former and from the left on the latter.

    The inverse hyperbolic sine is also known as `asinh` or ``sinh^-1``.
