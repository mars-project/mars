    Returns a bool tensor, where True if input element is complex.

    What is tested is whether the input has a non-zero imaginary part, not if
    the input type is complex.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input tensor.

    Returns
    -------
    out : Tensor of bools
        Output tensor.

    See Also
    --------
    isreal
    iscomplexobj : Return True if x is a complex type or an array of complex
                   numbers.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import mars.tensor as mt

    >>> mt.iscomplex([1+1j, 1+0j, 4.5, 3, 2, 2j]).execute()
    array([ True, False, False, False, False,  True])
