    Natural logarithm, element-wise.

    The natural logarithm `log` is the inverse of the exponential function,
    so that `log(exp(x)) = x`. The natural logarithm is logarithm in base
    `e`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input value.
    out : Tensor, None, or tuple of tensor and None, optional
        A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
        a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or `None`,
        a freshly-allocated tensor is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
        keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
    where : array_like, optional
        Values of True indicate to calculate the ufunc at that position, values
        of False indicate to leave the value in the output alone.
    **kwargs

    Returns
    -------
    y : Tensor
        The natural logarithm of `x`, element-wise.

    log10, log2, log1p

    Notes
    -----
    Logarithm is a multivalued function: for each `x` there is an infinite
    number of `z` such that `exp(z) = x`. The convention is to return the
    `z` whose imaginary part lies in `[-pi, pi]`.

    For real-valued input data types, `log` always returns real output. For
    each value that cannot be expressed as a real number or infinity, it
    yields ``nan`` and sets the `invalid` floating point error flag.

    For complex-valued input, `log` is a complex analytical function that
    has a branch cut `[-inf, 0]` and is continuous from above on it. `log`
    handles the floating-point negative zero as an infinitesimal negative
    number, conforming to the C99 standard.
