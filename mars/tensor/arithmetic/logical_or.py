    Compute the truth value of x1 OR x2 element-wise.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x1, x2 : array_like
        Logical OR is applied to the elements of `x1` and `x2`.
        They have to be of the same shape.
    out : Tensor, None, or tuple of Tensor and None, optional
        A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
        a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or `None`,
        a freshly-allocated tensor is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
        keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
    where : array_like, optional
        Values of True indicate to calculate the ufunc at that position, values
        of False indicate to leave the value in the output alone.
    **kwargs

    Returns
    -------
    y : Tensor or bool
        Boolean result with the same shape as `x1` and `x2` of the logical
        OR operation on elements of `x1` and `x2`.

    --------

    >>> mt.logical_or(True, False).execute()
    True
    >>> mt.logical_or([True, False], [False, False]).execute()

    >>> x = mt.arange(5)
    >>> mt.logical_or(x < 1, x > 3).execute()
