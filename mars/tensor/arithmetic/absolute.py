def absolute(x, out=None, where=None, **kwargs):
    r"""
    Calculate the absolute value element-wise.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input tensor.
    out : Tensor, None, or tuple of Tensor and None, optional
        A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
        a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or `None`,
        a freshly-allocated tensor is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
        keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
    where : array_like, optional
        Values of True indicate to calculate the ufunc at that position, values
        of False indicate to leave the value in the output alone.
    **kwargs

    Returns
    -------
    absolute : Tensor
        An tensor containing the absolute value of
        each element in `x`.  For complex input, ``a + ib``, the
        absolute value is :math:`\sqrt{ a^2 + b^2 }`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import mars.tensor as mt

    >>> x = mt.array([-1.2, 1.2])
    >>> mt.absolute(x).execute()
    array([ 1.2,  1.2])
    >>> mt.absolute(1.2 + 1j).execute()
