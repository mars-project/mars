    Return the truth value of (x1 < x2) element-wise.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x1, x2 : array_like
        Input tensors.  If ``x1.shape != x2.shape``, they must be
        broadcastable to a common shape (which may be the shape of one or
        the other).
    out : Tensor, None, or tuple of Tensor and None, optional
        A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
        a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or `None`,
        a freshly-allocated tensor is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
        keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
    where : array_like, optional
        Values of True indicate to calculate the ufunc at that position, values
        of False indicate to leave the value in the output alone.
    **kwargs

    Returns
    -------
    out : bool or Tensor of bool
        Array of bools, or a single bool if `x1` and `x2` are scalars.

    >>> mt.less([1, 2], [2, 2]).execute()
