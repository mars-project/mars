    Test element-wise for NaN and return result as a boolean tensor.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input tensor.
    out : Tensor, None, or tuple of Tensor and None, optional
        A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
        a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or `None`,
        a freshly-allocated tensor is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
        keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
    where : array_like, optional
        Values of True indicate to calculate the ufunc at that position, values
        of False indicate to leave the value in the output alone.
    **kwargs

    Returns
    -------
    y : Tensor or bool
        For scalar input, the result is a new boolean with value True if
        the input is NaN; otherwise the value is False.

        For array input, the result is a boolean tensor of the same
        dimensions as the input and the values are True if the
        corresponding element of the input is NaN; otherwise the values are
        False.

    Notes
    -----
    Mars uses the IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point for Arithmetic
    (IEEE 754). This means that Not a Number is not equivalent to infinity.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import mars.tensor as mt

    >>> mt.isnan(mt.nan).execute()
    True
    >>> mt.isnan(mt.inf).execute()
    False
    >>> mt.isnan([mt.log(-1.).execute(),1.,mt.log(0).execute()]).execute()
    array([ True, False, False])
