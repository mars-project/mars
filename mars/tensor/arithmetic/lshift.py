def lshift(x1, x2, out=None, where=None, **kwargs):
    """
    Shift the bits of an integer to the left.

    Bits are shifted to the left by appending `x2` 0s at the right of `x1`.
    Since the internal representation of numbers is in binary format, this
    operation is equivalent to multiplying `x1` by ``2**x2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x1 : array_like of integer type
        Input values.
    x2 : array_like of integer type
        Number of zeros to append to `x1`. Has to be non-negative.
    out : Tensor, None, or tuple of Tensor and None, optional
        A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
        a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or `None`,
        a freshly-allocated tensor is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
        keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
    where : array_like, optional
        Values of True indicate to calculate the ufunc at that position, values
        of False indicate to leave the value in the output alone.
    **kwargs

    Returns
    -------
    out : tensor of integer type
        Return `x1` with bits shifted `x2` times to the left.

    See Also
    --------
    right_shift : Shift the bits of an integer to the right.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import mars.tensor as mt

    >>> mt.left_shift(5, 2).execute()
    20

    >>> mt.left_shift(5, [1,2,3]).execute()
    array([10, 20, 40])
