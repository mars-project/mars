def min(a, axis=None, out=None, keepdims=None, combine_size=None):
    """
    Return the minimum of a tensor or minimum along an axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input data.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which to operate.  By default, flattened input is
        used.

        If this is a tuple of ints, the minimum is selected over multiple axes,
        instead of a single axis or all the axes as before.
    out : Tensor, optional
        Alternative output tensor in which to place the result.  Must
        be of the same shape and buffer length as the expected output.
        See `doc.ufuncs` (Section "Output arguments") for more details.

    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the input tensor.

        If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be
        passed through to the `amin` method of sub-classes of
        `Tensor`, however any non-default value will be.  If the
        sub-classes `sum` method does not implement `keepdims` any
        exceptions will be raised.
    combine_size: int, optional
        The number of chunks to combine.

    Returns
    -------
    amin : Tensor or scalar
        Minimum of `a`. If `axis` is None, the result is a scalar value.
        If `axis` is given, the result is an array of dimension
        ``a.ndim - 1``.

    See Also
    --------
    amax :
        The maximum value of a tensor along a given axis, propagating any NaNs.
    nanmin :
        The minimum value of a tensor along a given axis, ignoring any NaNs.
    minimum :
        Element-wise minimum of two tensors, propagating any NaNs.
    fmin :
        Element-wise minimum of two tensors, ignoring any NaNs.
    argmin :
        Return the indices of the minimum values.

    nanmax, maximum, fmax

    Notes
    -----
    NaN values are propagated, that is if at least one item is NaN, the
    corresponding min value will be NaN as well. To ignore NaN values
    (MATLAB behavior), please use nanmin.

    Don't use `amin` for element-wise comparison of 2 tensors; when
    ``a.shape[0]`` is 2, ``minimum(a[0], a[1])`` is faster than
    ``amin(a, axis=0)``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import mars.tensor as mt

    >>> a = mt.arange(4).reshape((2,2))
    >>> a.execute()
    array([[0, 1],
           [2, 3]])
    >>> mt.amin(a).execute()           # Minimum of the flattened array
    0
    >>> mt.amin(a, axis=0).execute()   # Minima along the first axis
    array([0, 1])
    >>> mt.amin(a, axis=1).execute()   # Minima along the second axis
    array([0, 2])

    >>> b = mt.arange(5, dtype=float)
    >>> b[2] = mt.NaN
    >>> mt.amin(b).execute()
    nan
    >>> mt.nanmin(b).execute()
    0.0
