def compress(condition, a, axis=None, out=None):
    """
    Return selected slices of a tensor along given axis.

    When working along a given axis, a slice along that axis is returned in
    `output` for each index where `condition` evaluates to True. When
    working on a 1-D array, `compress` is equivalent to `extract`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    condition : 1-D tensor of bools
        Tensor that selects which entries to return. If len(condition)
        is less than the size of `a` along the given axis, then output is
        truncated to the length of the condition tensor.
    a : array_like
        Tensor from which to extract a part.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which to take slices. If None (default), work on the
        flattened tensor.
    out : Tensor, optional
        Output tensor.  Its type is preserved and it must be of the right
        shape to hold the output.

    Returns
    -------
    compressed_array : Tensor
        A copy of `a` without the slices along axis for which `condition`
        is false.

    See Also

    mt.extract: Equivalent method when working on 1-D arrays

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import mars.tensor as mt

    >>> a = mt.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
    >>> a.execute()
    array([[1, 2],
           [3, 4],
           [5, 6]])
    >>> mt.compress([0, 1], a, axis=0).execute()
    array([[3, 4]])
    >>> mt.compress([False, True, True], a, axis=0).execute()
    array([[3, 4],
           [5, 6]])
    >>> mt.compress([False, True], a, axis=1).execute()
    array([[2],
           [4],
           [6]])

    Working on the flattened tensor does not return slices along an axis but
    selects elements.

    >>> mt.compress([False, True], a).execute()
    array([2])
