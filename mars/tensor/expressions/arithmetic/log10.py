def log10(x, out=None, where=None, **kwargs):

    Return the base 10 logarithm of the input tensor, element-wise.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input values.
    out : Tensor, None, or tuple of tensor and None, optional
        A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
        a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or `None`,
        a freshly-allocated tensor is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
        keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
    where : array_like, optional
        Values of True indicate to calculate the ufunc at that position, values
        of False indicate to leave the value in the output alone.
    **kwargs

    Returns
    -------
    y : Tensor
        The logarithm to the base 10 of `x`, element-wise. NaNs are
        returned where x is negative.

    Notes
    -----
    Logarithm is a multivalued function: for each `x` there is an infinite
    number of `z` such that `10**z = x`. The convention is to return the
    `z` whose imaginary part lies in `[-pi, pi]`.

    For real-valued input data types, `log10` always returns real output.
    For each value that cannot be expressed as a real number or infinity,
    it yields ``nan`` and sets the `invalid` floating point error flag.

    For complex-valued input, `log10` is a complex analytical function that
    has a branch cut `[-inf, 0]` and is continuous from above on it.
    `log10` handles the floating-point negative zero as an infinitesimal
    negative number, conforming to the C99 standard.
