def arctan(x, out=None, where=None, **kwargs):
    """
    Trigonometric inverse tangent, element-wise.

    The inverse of tan, so that if ``y = tan(x)`` then ``x = arctan(y)``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
    out : Tensor, None, or tuple of Tensor and None, optional
        A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
        a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or `None`,
        a freshly-allocated tensor is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
        keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
    where : array_like, optional
        Values of True indicate to calculate the ufunc at that position, values
        of False indicate to leave the value in the output alone.
    **kwargs

    Returns
    -------
    out : Tensor
        Out has the same shape as `x`.  Its real part is in
        ``[-pi/2, pi/2]`` (``arctan(+/-inf)`` returns ``+/-pi/2``).
        It is a scalar if `x` is a scalar.

    See Also
    --------
    arctan2 : The "four quadrant" arctan of the angle formed by (`x`, `y`)
        and the positive `x`-axis.
    angle : Argument of complex values.

    Notes
    -----
    `arctan` is a multi-valued function: for each `x` there are infinitely
    many numbers `z` such that tan(`z`) = `x`.  The convention is to return
    the angle `z` whose real part lies in [-pi/2, pi/2].

    For real-valued input data types, `arctan` always returns real output.
    For each value that cannot be expressed as a real number or infinity,
    it yields ``nan`` and sets the `invalid` floating point error flag.

    For complex-valued input, `arctan` is a complex analytic function that
    has [`1j, infj`] and [`-1j, -infj`] as branch cuts, and is continuous
    from the left on the former and from the right on the latter.

    The inverse tangent is also known as `atan` or tan^{-1}.

    Examples
    --------
    We expect the arctan of 0 to be 0, and of 1 to be pi/4:
    >>> import mars.tensor as mt

    >>> mt.arctan([0, 1]).execute()
    array([ 0.        ,  0.78539816])

    >>> mt.pi/4
    0.78539816339744828

    Plot arctan:

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> x = mt.linspace(-10, 10)
    >>> plt.plot(x.execute(), mt.arctan(x).execute())
    >>> plt.axis('tight')
    >>> plt.show()

    op = TensorArctan(**kwargs)
    return op(x, out=out, where=where)
