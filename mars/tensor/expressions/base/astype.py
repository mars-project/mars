def _astype(tensor, dtype, casting='unsafe', copy=True):
    """
    Copy of the tensor, cast to a specified type.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dtype : str or dtype
        Typecode or data-type to which the array is cast.
    casting : {'no', 'equiv', 'safe', 'same_kind', 'unsafe'}, optional
        Controls what kind of data casting may occur. Defaults to 'unsafe'
        for backwards compatibility.

          * 'no' means the data types should not be cast at all.
          * 'equiv' means only byte-order changes are allowed.
          * 'safe' means only casts which can preserve values are allowed.
          * 'same_kind' means only safe casts or casts within a kind,
            like float64 to float32, are allowed.
          * 'unsafe' means any data conversions may be done.
    copy : bool, optional
        By default, astype always returns a newly allocated array. If this
        is set to false, and the `dtype`, `order`, and `subok`
        requirements are satisfied, the input array is returned instead
        of a copy.

    Returns
    -------
    arr_t : Tensor
        Unless `copy` is False and the other conditions for returning the input
        array are satisfied (see description for `copy` input parameter), `arr_t`
        is a new tensor of the same shape as the input array, with dtype, order
        given by `dtype`, `order`.

    Notes
    -----
    astype method returns an error if the string
    dtype to cast to is not long enough in 'safe' casting mode to hold the max
    value of integer/float array that is being casted. Previously the casting
    was allowed even if the result was truncated.

    Raises
    ------
    ComplexWarning
        When casting from complex to float or int. To avoid this,
        one should use ``a.real.astype(t)``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import mars.tensor as mt

    >>> x = mt.array([1, 2, 2.5])
    >>> x.execute()
    array([ 1. ,  2. ,  2.5])

    >>> x.astype(int).execute()
    array([1, 2, 2])
