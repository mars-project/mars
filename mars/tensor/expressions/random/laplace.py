    r"""
    Draw samples from the Laplace or double exponential distribution with
    specified location (or mean) and scale (decay).

    The Laplace distribution is similar to the Gaussian/normal distribution,
    but is sharper at the peak and has fatter tails. It represents the
    difference between two independent, identically distributed exponential
    random variables.

    Parameters
    ----------
    loc : float or array_like of floats, optional
        The position, :math:`\mu`, of the distribution peak. Default is 0.
    scale : float or array_like of floats, optional
        :math:`\lambda`, the exponential decay. Default is 1.
    size : int or tuple of ints, optional
        Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
        ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
        a single value is returned if ``loc`` and ``scale`` are both scalars.
        Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(loc, scale).size`` samples are drawn.
    chunks : int or tuple of int or tuple of ints, optional
        Desired chunk size on each dimension
    gpu : bool, optional
        Allocate the tensor on GPU if True, False as default

    Returns
    -------
    out : Tensor or scalar
        Drawn samples from the parameterized Laplace distribution.

    Notes
    -----
    It has the probability density function

    .. math:: f(x; \mu, \lambda) = \frac{1}{2\lambda}
                                   \exp\left(-\frac{|x - \mu|}{\lambda}\right).

    The first law of Laplace, from 1774, states that the frequency
    of an error can be expressed as an exponential function of the
    absolute magnitude of the error, which leads to the Laplace
    distribution. For many problems in economics and health
    sciences, this distribution seems to model the data better
    than the standard Gaussian distribution.

    Examples
    --------
    Draw samples from the distribution

    >>> import mars.tensor as mt

    >>> loc, scale = 0., 1.
    >>> s = mt.random.laplace(loc, scale, 1000)

    Display the histogram of the samples, along with
    the probability density function:

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(s.execute(), 30, normed=True)
    >>> x = mt.arange(-8., 8., .01)
    >>> pdf = mt.exp(-abs(x-loc)/scale)/(2.*scale)
    >>> plt.plot(x.execute(), pdf.execute())

    Plot Gaussian for comparison:

    >>> g = (1/(scale * mt.sqrt(2 * np.pi)) *
    ...      mt.exp(-(x - loc)**2 / (2 * scale**2)))
    >>> plt.plot(x.execute(),g.execute())
