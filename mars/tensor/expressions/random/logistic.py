    r"""
    Draw samples from a logistic distribution.

    Samples are drawn from a logistic distribution with specified
    parameters, loc (location or mean, also median), and scale (>0).

    Parameters
    ----------
    loc : float or array_like of floats, optional
        Parameter of the distribution. Default is 0.
    scale : float or array_like of floats, optional
        Parameter of the distribution. Should be greater than zero.
        Default is 1.
    size : int or tuple of ints, optional
        Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
        ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
        a single value is returned if ``loc`` and ``scale`` are both scalars.
        Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(loc, scale).size`` samples are drawn.
    chunks : int or tuple of int or tuple of ints, optional
        Desired chunk size on each dimension
    gpu : bool, optional
        Allocate the tensor on GPU if True, False as default

    Returns
    -------
    out : Tensor or scalar
        Drawn samples from the parameterized logistic distribution.

    See Also
    --------
    scipy.stats.logistic : probability density function, distribution or
        cumulative density function, etc.

    Notes
    -----
    The probability density for the Logistic distribution is

    .. math:: P(x) = P(x) = \frac{e^{-(x-\mu)/s}}{s(1+e^{-(x-\mu)/s})^2},

    where :math:`\mu` = location and :math:`s` = scale.

    The Logistic distribution is used in Extreme Value problems where it
    can act as a mixture of Gumbel distributions, in Epidemiology, and by
    the World Chess Federation (FIDE) where it is used in the Elo ranking
    system, assuming the performance of each player is a logistically
    distributed random variable.

    --------
    Draw samples from the distribution:

    >>> import mars.tensor as mt
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    >>> loc, scale = 10, 1
    >>> s = mt.random.logistic(loc, scale, 10000)
    >>> count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(s.execute(), bins=50)

    #   plot against distribution

    >>> def logist(x, loc, scale):
    ...     return mt.exp((loc-x)/scale)/(scale*(1+mt.exp((loc-x)/scale))**2)
    >>> plt.plot(bins, logist(bins, loc, scale).execute()*count.max()/\
    ... logist(bins, loc, scale).max().execute())
    >>> plt.show()
