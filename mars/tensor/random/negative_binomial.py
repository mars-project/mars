    Draw samples from a negative binomial distribution.

    Samples are drawn from a negative binomial distribution with specified
    parameters, `n` trials and `p` probability of success where `n` is an
    integer > 0 and `p` is in the interval [0, 1].

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int or array_like of ints
        Parameter of the distribution, > 0. Floats are also accepted,
        but they will be truncated to integers.
    p : float or array_like of floats
        Parameter of the distribution, >= 0 and <=1.
    size : int or tuple of ints, optional
        Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
        ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
        a single value is returned if ``n`` and ``p`` are both scalars.
        Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(n, p).size`` samples are drawn.
    chunk_size : int or tuple of int or tuple of ints, optional
        Desired chunk size on each dimension
    gpu : bool, optional
        Allocate the tensor on GPU if True, False as default
    dtype : data-type, optional
      Data-type of the returned tensor.

    Returns
    -------
    out : Tensor or scalar
        Drawn samples from the parameterized negative binomial distribution,
        where each sample is equal to N, the number of trials it took to
        achieve n - 1 successes, N - (n - 1) failures, and a success on the,
        (N + n)th trial.

    Notes
    -----
    The probability density for the negative binomial distribution is

    .. math:: P(N;n,p) = \binom{N+n-1}{n-1}p^{n}(1-p)^{N},

    where :math:`n-1` is the number of successes, :math:`p` is the
    probability of success, and :math:`N+n-1` is the number of trials.
    The negative binomial distribution gives the probability of n-1
    successes and N failures in N+n-1 trials, and success on the (N+n)th
    trial.

    If one throws a die repeatedly until the third time a "1" appears,
    then the probability distribution of the number of non-"1"s that
    appear before the third "1" is a negative binomial distribution.

    Examples
    --------
    Draw samples from the distribution:

    A real world example. A company drills wild-cat oil
    exploration wells, each with an estimated probability of
    success of 0.1.  What is the probability of having one success
    for each successive well, that is what is the probability of a
    single success after drilling 5 wells, after 6 wells, etc.?

    >>> import mars.tensor as mt

    >>> s = mt.random.negative_binomial(1, 0.1, 100000)
    >>> for i in range(1, 11):
    ...    probability = (mt.sum(s<i) / 100000.).execute()
    ...    print i, "wells drilled, probability of one success =", probability
