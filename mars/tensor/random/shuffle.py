def shuffle(random_state, x, axis=0):
    r"""
    Modify a sequence in-place by shuffling its contents.
    The order of sub-arrays is changed but their contents remains the same.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        The array or list to be shuffled.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis which `x` is shuffled along. Default is 0.

    Returns
    -------
    None

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import mars.tensor as mt
    >>> rng = mt.random.RandomState()
    >>> arr = mt.arange(10)
    >>> rng.shuffle(arr)
    >>> arr.execute()
    array([0, 1, 4, 2, 8, 6, 5, 9, 3, 7]) # random

    >>> arr = mt.arange(9).reshape((3, 3))
    >>> rng.shuffle(arr)
    >>> arr.execute()
    array([[6, 7, 8], # random
           [0, 1, 2],
           [3, 4, 5]])
