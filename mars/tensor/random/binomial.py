    r"""
    Draw samples from a binomial distribution.

    Samples are drawn from a binomial distribution with specified
    parameters, n trials and p probability of success where
    n an integer >= 0 and p is in the interval [0,1]. (n may be
    input as a float, but it is truncated to an integer in use)

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int or array_like of ints
        Parameter of the distribution, >= 0. Floats are also accepted,
        but they will be truncated to integers.
    p : float or array_like of floats
        Parameter of the distribution, >= 0 and <=1.
    size : int or tuple of ints, optional
        Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
        ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
        a single value is returned if ``n`` and ``p`` are both scalars.
        Otherwise, ``mt.broadcast(n, p).size`` samples are drawn.
    chunk_size : int or tuple of int or tuple of ints, optional
        Desired chunk size on each dimension
    gpu : bool, optional
        Allocate the tensor on GPU if True, False as default
    dtype : data-type, optional
      Data-type of the returned tensor.

    Returns
    -------
    out : Tensor or scalar
        Drawn samples from the parameterized binomial distribution, where
        each sample is equal to the number of successes over the n trials.

    See Also
    --------
    scipy.stats.binom : probability density function, distribution or
        cumulative density function, etc.

    Notes
    -----
    The probability density for the binomial distribution is

    .. math:: P(N) = \binom{n}{N}p^N(1-p)^{n-N},

    where :math:`n` is the number of trials, :math:`p` is the probability
    of success, and :math:`N` is the number of successes.

    When estimating the standard error of a proportion in a population by
    using a random sample, the normal distribution works well unless the
    product p*n <=5, where p = population proportion estimate, and n =
    number of samples, in which case the binomial distribution is used
    instead. For example, a sample of 15 people shows 4 who are left
    handed, and 11 who are right handed. Then p = 4/15 = 27%. 0.27*15 = 4,
    so the binomial distribution should be used in this case.

    Examples
    --------
    Draw samples from the distribution:

    >>> import mars.tensor as mt

    >>> n, p = 10, .5  # number of trials, probability of each trial
    >>> s = mt.random.binomial(n, p, 1000).execute()
    # result of flipping a coin 10 times, tested 1000 times.

    A real world example. A company drills 9 wild-cat oil exploration
    wells, each with an estimated probability of success of 0.1. All nine
    wells fail. What is the probability of that happening?

    Let's do 20,000 trials of the model, and count the number that
    generate zero positive results.

    >>> (mt.sum(mt.random.binomial(9, 0.1, 20000) == 0)/20000.).execute()
    # answer = 0.38885, or 38%.
