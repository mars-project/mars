def standard_cauchy(random_state, size=None, chunk_size=None, gpu=None, dtype=None):
    r"""
    Draw samples from a standard Cauchy distribution with mode = 0.

    Also known as the Lorentz distribution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    size : int or tuple of ints, optional
        Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
        ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
        single value is returned.
    chunk_size : int or tuple of int or tuple of ints, optional
        Desired chunk size on each dimension
    gpu : bool, optional
        Allocate the tensor on GPU if True, False as default
    dtype : data-type, optional
      Data-type of the returned tensor.

    Returns
    -------
    samples : Tensor or scalar
        The drawn samples.

    Notes
    -----
    The probability density function for the full Cauchy distribution is

    .. math:: P(x; x_0, \gamma) = \frac{1}{\pi \gamma \bigl[ 1+
              (\frac{x-x_0}{\gamma})^2 \bigr] }

    and the Standard Cauchy distribution just sets :math:`x_0=0` and
    :math:`\gamma=1`

    The Cauchy distribution arises in the solution to the driven harmonic
    oscillator problem, and also describes spectral line broadening. It
    also describes the distribution of values at which a line tilted at
    a random angle will cut the x axis.

    When studying hypothesis tests that assume normality, seeing how the
    tests perform on data from a Cauchy distribution is a good indicator of
    their sensitivity to a heavy-tailed distribution, since the Cauchy looks
    very much like a Gaussian distribution, but with heavier tails.

    Draw samples and plot the distribution:

    >>> import mars.tensor as mt
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    >>> s = mt.random.standard_cauchy(1000000)
    >>> s = s[(s>-25) & (s<25)]  # truncate distribution so it plots well
    >>> plt.hist(s.execute(), bins=100)
    >>> plt.show()
