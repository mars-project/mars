    """
    Cressie-Read power divergence statistic and goodness of fit test.

    This function tests the null hypothesis that the categorical data
    has the given frequencies, using the Cressie-Read power divergence
    statistic.

    Parameters
    ----------
    f_obs : array_like
        Observed frequencies in each category.
    f_exp : array_like, optional
        Expected frequencies in each category.  By default the categories are
        assumed to be equally likely.
    ddof : int, optional
        "Delta degrees of freedom": adjustment to the degrees of freedom
        for the p-value.  The p-value is computed using a chi-squared
        distribution with ``k - 1 - ddof`` degrees of freedom, where `k`
        is the number of observed frequencies.  The default value of `ddof`
        is 0.
    axis : int or None, optional
        The axis of the broadcast result of `f_obs` and `f_exp` along which to
        apply the test.  If axis is None, all values in `f_obs` are treated
        as a single data set.  Default is 0.
    lambda_ : float or str, optional
        The power in the Cressie-Read power divergence statistic.  The default
        is 1.  For convenience, `lambda_` may be assigned one of the following
        strings, in which case the corresponding numerical value is used::

            String              Value   Description
            "pearson"             1     Pearson's chi-squared statistic.
                                        In this case, the function is
                                        equivalent to `stats.chisquare`.
            "log-likelihood"      0     Log-likelihood ratio. Also known as
                                        the G-test [3]_.
            "freeman-tukey"      -1/2   Freeman-Tukey statistic.
            "mod-log-likelihood" -1     Modified log-likelihood ratio.
            "neyman"             -2     Neyman's statistic.
            "cressie-read"        2/3   The power recommended in [5]_.

    Returns
    -------
    statistic : float or ndarray
        The Cressie-Read power divergence test statistic.  The value is
        a float if `axis` is None or if` `f_obs` and `f_exp` are 1-D.
    pvalue : float or ndarray
        The p-value of the test.  The value is a float if `ddof` and the
        return value `stat` are scalars.

    See Also
    --------
    chisquare

    Notes
    -----
    This test is invalid when the observed or expected frequencies in each
    category are too small.  A typical rule is that all of the observed
    and expected frequencies should be at least 5.

    When `lambda_` is less than zero, the formula for the statistic involves
    dividing by `f_obs`, so a warning or error may be generated if any value
    in `f_obs` is 0.

    Similarly, a warning or error may be generated if any value in `f_exp` is
    zero when `lambda_` >= 0.

    The default degrees of freedom, k-1, are for the case when no parameters
    of the distribution are estimated. If p parameters are estimated by
    efficient maximum likelihood then the correct degrees of freedom are
    k-1-p. If the parameters are estimated in a different way, then the
    dof can be between k-1-p and k-1. However, it is also possible that
    the asymptotic distribution is not a chisquare, in which case this
    test is not appropriate.

    This function handles masked arrays.  If an element of `f_obs` or `f_exp`
    is masked, then data at that position is ignored, and does not count
    towards the size of the data set.

    Examples
    --------
    (See `chisquare` for more examples.)

    When just `f_obs` is given, it is assumed that the expected frequencies
    are uniform and given by the mean of the observed frequencies.  Here we
    perform a G-test (i.e. use the log-likelihood ratio statistic):

    >>> import mars.tensor as mt
    >>> from mars.tensor.stats import power_divergence
    >>> power_divergence([16, 18, 16, 14, 12, 12], lambda_='log-likelihood').execute()
    (2.006573162632538, 0.84823476779463769)

    The expected frequencies can be given with the `f_exp` argument:

    >>> power_divergence([16, 18, 16, 14, 12, 12],
    ...                  f_exp=[16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 8],
    ...                  lambda_='log-likelihood').execute()
    (3.3281031458963746, 0.6495419288047497)

    When `f_obs` is 2-D, by default the test is applied to each column.

    >>> obs = mt.array([[16, 18, 16, 14, 12, 12], [32, 24, 16, 28, 20, 24]]).T
    >>> obs.shape
    (6, 2)
    >>> power_divergence(obs, lambda_="log-likelihood").execute()
    (array([ 2.00657316,  6.77634498]), array([ 0.84823477,  0.23781225]))

    By setting ``axis=None``, the test is applied to all data in the array,
    which is equivalent to applying the test to the flattened array.

    >>> power_divergence(obs, axis=None).execute()
    (23.31034482758621, 0.015975692534127565)
    >>> power_divergence(obs.ravel()).execute()
    (23.31034482758621, 0.015975692534127565)

    `ddof` is the change to make to the default degrees of freedom.

    >>> power_divergence([16, 18, 16, 14, 12, 12], ddof=1).execute()
    (2.0, 0.73575888234288467)

    `f_obs` and `f_exp` are also broadcast.  In the following, `f_obs` has
    shape (6,) and `f_exp` has shape (2, 6), so the result of broadcasting
    `f_obs` and `f_exp` has shape (2, 6).  To compute the desired chi-squared
    statistics, we must use ``axis=1``:

    >>> power_divergence([16, 18, 16, 14, 12, 12],
    ...                  f_exp=[[16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 8],
    ...                         [8, 20, 20, 16, 12, 12]],
    ...                  axis=1)
    (array([ 3.5 ,  9.25]), array([ 0.62338763,  0.09949846]))
