        Pool makes sure _no more_ and _no less_ (if possible) than `size`
        spawned coroutines are active at the same time. _spawned_ means created
        and scheduled with one of the pool interface methods, _active_ means
        coroutine function started executing it's code, as opposed to
        _waiting_ -- which waits for pool space without entering coroutine
        function.

        Support asynchronous context management protocol (`aenter`, `aexit`).

        The main idea behind spwaning methods is -- they return newly created
        futures, not "native" ones, returned by `pool.create_task` or used for
        `await`. Read more about this in readme and docstrings below.

        `coro` result, so first positional argument is mandatory.

        if coroutine did not crash and wasn't cancelled. In case any exception

        errors, you can pass callback without seconds and third positional
        arguments.

        If context `ctx` is passed to `spawn`, it will be re-sent to callback
        as third argument. If you don't plan to use any context, you can create
        callback with positional arguments only for result and error.
