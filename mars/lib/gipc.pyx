    Allows for gevent-cooperative transmission of data between greenlets within

    default behavior allows for transmission of any picklable Python object.

    The transport layer is based on ``os.pipe()`` (i.e.
    `CreatePipe() <https://goo.gl/CiIWvo>`_ on Windows and
    `pipe() <http://goo.gl/it6rFW>`_ on POSIX-compliant systems).

        - If ``False`` (default), create a unidirectional pipe-based message
          transport channel and return the corresponding handle pair, a 2-tuple
          with the first element of type  ``_GIPCReader`` and the second
          element of type ``_GIPCWriter``.
        - If ``True``, create a bidirectional message transport channel (using
          two pipes internally) and return the corresponding 2-tuple with both
          elements being of type ``_GIPCDuplexHandle``.

    :arg encoder:
        Defines the entity used for object serialization before writing object
        ``o`` to the pipe via ``put(o)``. Must be either a callable returning
        a byte string, ``None``, or ``'default'``. ``'default'`` translates to
        ``pickle.dumps`` (in this mode, any pickleable Python object can be
        provided to ``put()`` and transmitted through the pipe). When setting
        this to ``None``, no automatic object serialization is performed. In
        that case only byte strings are allowed to be provided to ``put()``,
        and a ``TypeError`` is thrown otherwise. A ``TypeError`` will also be
        thrown if the encoder callable does not return a byte string.

    :arg decoder:
        Defines the entity used for data deserialization after reading raw
        binary data from the pipe. Must be a callable retrieving a byte string
        as first and only argument, ``None`` or ``'default'``. ``'default'``
        translates to ``pickle.loads``. When setting this to ``None``, no data
        decoding is performed, and a raw byte string is returned.

    :returns:
        - ``duplex=False``: ``(reader, writer)`` 2-tuple. The first element is
          of type :class:`gipc._GIPCReader`, the second of type
          :class:`gipc._GIPCWriter`. Both inherit from
          :class:`gipc._GIPCHandle`.
        - ``duplex=True``: ``(handle, handle)`` 2-tuple. Both elements are of
          type :class:`gipc._GIPCDuplexHandle`.


    :class:`gipc._GIPCHandle` and :class:`gipc._GIPCDuplexHandle`  instances
    are recommended to be used with a context manager as indicated in the
    following examples::

            do_something(r, w)

    ::

        reader, writer = pipe()
        with reader:
            do_something(reader)
            with writer as w:
                do_something(w)

    ::

        with pipe(duplex=True) as (h1, h2):

            h2.put(2)
            assert h1.get() == 2

    An example for using the encoder/decoder arguments for implementing JSON
    (de)serialization::

        import json
        enc = lambda o: json.dumps(o).encode("ascii")
        dec = lambda b: json.loads(b.decode("ascii"))
        with pipe(encoder=enc, decoder=dec) as (r, w):
            ...

    Note that JSON representation is text whereas the encoder/decoder callables
    must return/accept byte strings, as ensured here by ASCII en/decoding. Also
    note that in practice JSON serializaton has normally no advantage over
    pickling, so this is just an educational example.

        the SIGPIPE action in children is inherited from the parent. In

        ignored.

        always return ``None``. Calling ``gipc._GProcess.join()`` is not

    # For each `_GProcess`, a libev child watcher is started in the modified
    # `start()` method below. The modified `join()` method is adjusted to this
    # libev child watcher-based child monitoring.
    # `multiprocessing.Process.join()` is entirely surpassed, but resembled.

    # After initialization of the first libev child watcher, i.e. after
    # initialization of the first _GProcess instance, libev handles SIGCHLD
    # signals. Dead children become reaped by the libev event loop. The
    # children's status code is evaluated by libev. In conclusion, installation
    # of the libev SIGCHLD handler renders multiprocessing's child monitoring
    # useless and even hindering.

    # Any call to os.waitpid can make libev miss certain SIGCHLD
    # events. According to
    # http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/waitpid.html
    #
    # "If [...] the implementation queues the SIGCHLD signal, then if wait()
    #  or waitpid() returns because the status of a child process is available,
    #  any pending SIGCHLD signal associated with the process ID of the child

        What follows now is an overview for the process of transferring a
        Windows pipe handle to a child process, for different Python versions
        (explanation / background can be found below):

        Python versions < 3.4:
            1)   In the parent, get WinAPI handle from C file descriptor via
                 msvcrt.get_osfhandle().
            2)   WinAPI call DuplicateHandle(... ,bInheritHandle=True) in
                 parent. Close old handle, let inheritable duplicate live on.
            2.5) multiprocessing internals invoke WinAPI call CreateProcess(...,
                 InheritHandles=True).
            3)   Close the duplicate in the parent.
            4)   Use msvcrt.open_osfhandle() in child for converting the Windows
                 pipe handle to a C file descriptor, and for setting the
                 (read/write)-only access flag. This file descriptor will be
                 used by user code.

        Python versions >= 3.4:
            1)   Same as above.
            2)   Store handle and process ID. Both are integers that will be
                 pickled to and used by the child.
            2.5) multiprocessing internals invoke WinAPI call
                 CreateProcess(..., InheritHandles=False).
            3)   Steal the Windows pipe handle from the parent process: in the
                 child use the parent's process ID for getting a WinAPI handle
                 to the parent process via WinAPI call OpenProcess(). Use option
                 PROCESS_DUP_HANDLE as desired access right. Invoke
                 DuplicateHandle() in the child and use the handle to the parent
                 process as source process handle. Use the
                 DUPLICATE_CLOSE_SOURCE and the DUPLICATE_SAME_ACCESS flags. The
                 result is a Windows pipe handle, "stolen" from the parent.
            4)   Same as above.

        Background:

        By default, file descriptors are not inherited by child processes on
        Windows. However, they can be made inheritable via calling the system
        function `DuplicateHandle` while setting `bInheritHandle` to True.
        From MSDN:
            bInheritHandle:
                A variable that indicates whether the handle is inheritable.
                If TRUE, the duplicate handle can be inherited by new processes
                created by the target process. If FALSE, the new handle cannot
                be inherited.
        The internals of Python's `subprocess` and `multiprocessing` make use of
        this. There is, however, no officially exposed Python API. Nevertheless,
        the function `multiprocessing.forking.duplicate` (in Python versions
        smaller than 3.4) and `multiprocessing.reduction.duplicate` (>= 3.4)
        seems to be safely usable. In all versions, `duplicate` is part of
        `multiprocessing.reduction`. As of 2015-07-20, the reduction module is
        part of multiprocessing in all Python versions from 2.6 to 3.5.

        The just outlined approach (DuplicateHandle() in parent, automatically
        inherit it in child) only works for Python versions smaller than 3.4:
        from Python 3.4 on, the child process is created with CreateProcess()'s
        `InheritHandles` attribute set to False (this was explicitly set to True
        in older Python versions). A different method needs to be used, referred
        to as "stealing" the handle: DuplicateHandle can be called in the child
        for retrieving the handle from the parent while using the
        _winapi.DUPLICATE_CLOSE_SOURCE flag, which automatically closes the
        handle in the parent. This method is used by
        `multiprocessing.popen_spawn_win32` and implemented in
        `multiprocessing.reduction.steal_handle`.

            - Relevant for large messages (O_NONBLOCK enabled,
              n > PIPE_BUF (4096 Byte, usually)):
                "If the pipe is full, then write(2) fails, with errno set
                to EAGAIN. Otherwise, from 1 to n bytes may be written (i.e.,
                a "partial write" may occur; the caller should check the
                return value from write(2) to see how many bytes were
                actually written), and these bytes may be interleaved with
                writes by other processes."

            EAGAIN is handled within _write_nonblocking; partial writes here.
