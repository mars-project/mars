"**diff** -- The n-th differences. The shape of the output is the same as "
"`a` except along `axis` where the dimension is smaller by `n`. The type "
"of the output is the same as the type of the difference between any two "
"elements of `a`. This is the same as the type of `a` in most cases. A "
"notable exception is `datetime64`, which results in a `timedelta64` "
"output tensor."
