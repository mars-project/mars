msgid "If both arguments are 2-D they are multiplied like conventional matrices."

"If either argument is N-D, N > 2, it is treated as a stack of matrices "
"residing in the last two indexes and broadcast accordingly."

"If the first argument is 1-D, it is promoted to a matrix by prepending a "
"1 to its dimensions. After matrix multiplication the prepended 1 is "
"removed."

"If the second argument is 1-D, it is promoted to a matrix by appending a "
"1 to its dimensions. After matrix multiplication the appended 1 is "

"Multiplication by a scalar is not allowed, use ``*`` instead. Note that "
"multiplying a stack of matrices with a vector will result in a stack of "
"vectors, but matmul will not recognize it as such."
msgstr ""

#: mars.tensor.matmul:20 of
msgid "``matmul`` differs from ``dot`` in two important ways."

"Output argument. This must have the exact kind that would be returned if "
"it was not used. In particular, it must have the right type, and its "
"dtype must be the dtype that would be returned for `dot(a,b)`. This is a "
"performance feature. Therefore, if these conditions are not met, an "
"exception is raised, instead of attempting to be flexible."

"**output** -- Returns the dot product of `a` and `b`.  If `a` and `b` are"
