"The multinomial distribution is a multivariate generalisation of the "
"binomial distribution.  Take an experiment with one of ``p`` possible "
"outcomes.  An example of such an experiment is throwing a dice, where the"
" outcome can be 1 through 6.  Each sample drawn from the distribution "
"represents `n` such experiments.  Its values, ``X_i = [X_0, X_1, ..., "
"X_p]``, represent the number of times the outcome was ``i``."
