"**y** -- An tensor of the same shape as `x`, containing the positive "
"square-root of each element in `x`.  If any element in `x` is complex, a "
"complex tensor is returned (and the square-roots of negative reals are "
"calculated).  If all of the elements in `x` are real, so is `y`, with "
"negative elements returning ``nan``. If `out` was provided, `y` is a "
"reference to it."
