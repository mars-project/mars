"Covariance indicates the level to which two variables vary together. If "
"we examine N-dimensional samples, :math:`X = [x_1, x_2, ... x_N]^T`, then"
" the covariance matrix element :math:`C_{ij}` is the covariance of "
":math:`x_i` and :math:`x_j`. The element :math:`C_{ii}` is the variance "
"of :math:`x_i`."
