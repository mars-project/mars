"The average squared deviation is normally calculated as ``x.sum() / N``, "

"- ddof`` is used instead. In standard statistical practice, ``ddof=1`` "
"provides an unbiased estimator of the variance of the infinite "
"population. ``ddof=0`` provides a maximum likelihood estimate of the "
"variance for normally distributed variables. The standard deviation "
"computed in this function is the square root of the estimated variance, "
"so even with ``ddof=1``, it will not be an unbiased estimate of the "
"standard deviation per se."

"For floating-point input, the *std* is computed using the same precision "
