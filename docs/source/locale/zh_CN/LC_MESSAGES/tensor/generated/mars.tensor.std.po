"The standard deviation is the square root of the average of the squared "
"deviations from the mean, i.e., ``std = sqrt(mean(abs(x - "
"x.mean())**2))``."
msgstr ""

#: mars.tensor.std:51 of
msgid ""
"The average squared deviation is normally calculated as ``x.sum() / N``, "
"where ``N = len(x)``.  If, however, `ddof` is specified, the divisor ``N "
"- ddof`` is used instead. In standard statistical practice, ``ddof=1`` "
"provides an unbiased estimator of the variance of the infinite "
"population. ``ddof=0`` provides a maximum likelihood estimate of the "
"variance for normally distributed variables. The standard deviation "
"computed in this function is the square root of the estimated variance, "
"so even with ``ddof=1``, it will not be an unbiased estimate of the "
"standard deviation per se."
msgstr ""

#: mars.tensor.std:61 of
msgid ""
"Note that, for complex numbers, `std` takes the absolute value before "
"squaring, so that the result is always real and nonnegative."
msgstr ""

#: mars.tensor.std:64 of
msgid ""
"For floating-point input, the *std* is computed using the same precision "
"the input has. Depending on the input data, this can cause the results to"
" be inaccurate, especially for float32 (see example below). Specifying a "
"higher-accuracy accumulator using the `dtype` keyword can alleviate this "
"issue."
