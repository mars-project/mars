"Due to floating point rounding the resulting tensor may not be Hermitian,"
" the diagonal elements may not be 1, and the elements may not satisfy the"

"This function accepts but discards arguments `bias` and `ddof`.  This is "
"for backwards compatibility with previous versions of this function.  "
"These arguments had no effect on the return values of the function and "
