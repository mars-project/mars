"The elements of `a` are read using this index order. 'C' means to index "
"the elements in row-major, C-style order, with the last axis index "
"changing fastest, back to the first axis index changing slowest.  'F' "
"means to index the elements in column-major, Fortran-style order, with "
"the first index changing fastest, and the last index changing slowest. "
"Note that the 'C' and 'F' options take no account of the memory layout of"
" the underlying array, and only refer to the order of axis indexing.  'A'"
" means to read the elements in Fortran-like index order if `a` is Fortran"
" *contiguous* in memory, C-like order otherwise.  'K' means to read the "
"elements in the order they occur in memory, except for reversing the data"
" when strides are negative.  By default, 'C' index order is used."
