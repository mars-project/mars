"A tensor, or list of tensors, each with ``a.ndim >= 3``.  Copies are "
"avoided where possible, and views with three or more dimensions are "
"returned.  For example, a 1-D tensor of shape ``(N,)`` becomes a view of "
"shape ``(1, N, 1)``, and a 2-D tensor of shape ``(M, N)`` becomes a view "
"of shape ``(M, N, 1)``."
