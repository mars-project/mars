"SVD is usually described for the factorization of a 2D matrix :math:`A`. "
"The higher-dimensional case will be discussed below. In the 2D case, SVD "
"is written as :math:`A = U S V^H`, where :math:`A = a`, :math:`U= u`, "
":math:`S= \\mathtt{np.diag}(s)` and :math:`V^H = vh`. The 1D tensor `s` "
"contains the singular values of `a` and `u` and `vh` are unitary. The "
"rows of `vh` are the eigenvectors of :math:`A^H A` and the columns of `u`"
" are the eigenvectors of :math:`A A^H`. In both cases the corresponding "
"(possibly non-zero) eigenvalues are given by ``s**2``."

"If `a` has more than two dimensions, then broadcasting rules apply, as "
"explained in :ref:`routines.linalg-broadcasting`. This means that SVD is "
"working in \"stacked\" mode: it iterates over all indices of the first "
"``a.ndim - 2`` dimensions and for each combination SVD is applied to the "
"last two indices. The matrix `a` can be reconstructed from the "
"decomposition with either ``(u * s[..., None, :]) @ vh`` or ``u @ (s[...,"
" None] * vh)``. (The ``@`` operator can be replaced by the function "
"``mt.matmul`` for python versions below 3.5.)"
