"Mars uses the IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point for Arithmetic "
"(IEEE 754). This means that Not a Number is not equivalent to infinity. "
"Also that positive infinity is not equivalent to negative infinity. But "
"infinity is equivalent to positive infinity.  Errors result if the second"
" argument is also supplied when `x` is a scalar input, or if first and "
"second arguments have different shapes."
