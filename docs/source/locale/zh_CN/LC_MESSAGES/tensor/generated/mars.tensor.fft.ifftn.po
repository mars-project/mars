"The input, analogously to `ifft`, should be ordered in the same way as is"

"all axes in the low-order corner, the positive frequency terms in the "
"first half of all axes, the term for the Nyquist frequency in the middle "
"of all axes and the negative frequency terms in the second half of all "
