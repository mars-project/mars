"This is equivalent to concatenation along the second axis, except for 1-D"
" tensors where it concatenates along the first axis. Rebuilds tensors "
"divided by `hsplit`."

"This function makes most sense for tensors with up to 3 dimensions. For "
"instance, for pixel-data with a height (first axis), width (second axis),"
" and r/g/b channels (third axis). The functions `concatenate`, `stack` "
"and `block` provide more general stacking and concatenation operations."
