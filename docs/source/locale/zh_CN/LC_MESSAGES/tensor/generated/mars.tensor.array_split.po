"Please refer to the ``split`` documentation.  The only difference between"
" these functions is that ``array_split`` allows `indices_or_sections` to "
"be an integer that does *not* equally divide the axis. For a tensor of "
"length l that should be split into n sections, it returns l % n sub-"
"arrays of size l//n + 1 and the rest of size l//n."
