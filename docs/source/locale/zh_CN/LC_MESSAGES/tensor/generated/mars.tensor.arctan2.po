"The quadrant (i.e., branch) is chosen so that ``arctan2(x1, x2)`` is the "
"signed angle in radians between the ray ending at the origin and passing "
"through the point (1,0), and the ray ending at the origin and passing "
"through the point (`x2`, `x1`).  (Note the role reversal: the "
"\"`y`-coordinate\" is the first function parameter, the "
"\"`x`-coordinate\" is the second.)  By IEEE convention, this function is "
"defined for `x2` = +/-0 and for either or both of `x1` and `x2` = +/-inf "
