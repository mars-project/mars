"The methods to estimate the optimal number of bins are well founded in "
"literature, and are inspired by the choices R provides for histogram "
"visualisation. Note that having the number of bins proportional to "
":math:`n^{1/3}` is asymptotically optimal, which is why it appears in "
"most estimators. These are simply plug-in methods that give good starting"
" points for number of bins. In the equations below, :math:`h` is the "
"binwidth and :math:`n_h` is the number of bins. All estimators that "
"compute bin counts are recast to bin width using the `ptp` of the data. "
"The final bin count is obtained from ``np.round(np.ceil(range / h))``."
