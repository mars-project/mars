"Values are generated within the half-open interval ``[start, stop)`` (in "
"other words, the interval including `start` but excluding `stop`). For "
"integer arguments the function is equivalent to the Python built-in "
"`range <http://docs.python.org/lib/built-in-funcs.html>`_ function, but "
"returns a tensor rather than a list."
