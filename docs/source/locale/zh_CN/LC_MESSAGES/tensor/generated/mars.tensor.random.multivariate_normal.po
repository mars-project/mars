"The multivariate normal, multinormal or Gaussian distribution is a "
"generalization of the one-dimensional normal distribution to higher "
"dimensions.  Such a distribution is specified by its mean and covariance "
"matrix.  These parameters are analogous to the mean (average or "
"\"center\") and variance (standard deviation, or \"width,\" squared) of "
"the one-dimensional normal distribution."
