"`arctan` is a multi-valued function: for each `x` there are infinitely "
"many numbers `z` such that tan(`z`) = `x`.  The convention is to return "
"the angle `z` whose real part lies in [-pi/2, pi/2]."

"For real-valued input data types, `arctan` always returns real output. "
"For each value that cannot be expressed as a real number or infinity, it "
"yields ``nan`` and sets the `invalid` floating point error flag."

"For complex-valued input, `arctan` is a complex analytic function that "
"has [`1j, infj`] and [`-1j, -infj`] as branch cuts, and is continuous "
"from the left on the former and from the right on the latter."
