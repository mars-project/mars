"Raise each base in `x1` to the positionally-corresponding power in `x2`. "
"`x1` and `x2` must be broadcastable to the same shape. This differs from "
"the power function in that integers, float16, and float32  are promoted "
"to floats with a minimum precision of float64 so that the result is "
"always inexact.  The intent is that the function will return a usable "
"result for negative powers and seldom overflow for positive powers."
