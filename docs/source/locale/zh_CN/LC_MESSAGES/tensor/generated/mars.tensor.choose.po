"Given an \"index\" tensor (`a`) of integers and a sequence of `n` tensors"
" (`choices`), `a` and each choice tensor are first broadcast, as "
"necessary, to tensors of a common shape; calling these *Ba* and "
"*Bchoices[i], i = 0,...,n-1* we have that, necessarily, ``Ba.shape == "
"Bchoices[i].shape`` for each `i`.  Then, a new array with shape "
"``Ba.shape`` is created as follows:"

"if ``mode=raise`` (the default), then, first of all, each element of `a` "
"(and thus `Ba`) must be in the range `[0, n-1]`; now, suppose that `i` "
"(in that range) is the value at the `(j0, j1, ..., jm)` position in `Ba` "
"- then the value at the same position in the new array is the value in "
"`Bchoices[i]` at that same position;"

"if ``mode=wrap``, values in `a` (and thus `Ba`) may be any (signed) "
"integer; modular arithmetic is used to map integers outside the range "

"if ``mode=clip``, values in `a` (and thus `Ba`) may be any (signed) "
