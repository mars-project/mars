"Compare two tensors and returns a new tensor containing the element-wise "
"maxima. If one of the elements being compared is a NaN, then the non-nan "
"element is returned. If both elements are NaNs then the first is "
"returned.  The latter distinction is important for complex NaNs, which "
"are defined as at least one of the real or imaginary parts being a NaN. "
"The net effect is that NaNs are ignored when possible."
