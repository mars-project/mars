"The F statistic is used to compare in-group variances to between-group "
"variances. Calculating the distribution depends on the sampling, and so "
"it is a function of the respective degrees of freedom in the problem.  "
"The variable `dfnum` is the number of samples minus one, the between-"
"groups degrees of freedom, while `dfden` is the within-groups degrees of "
"freedom, the sum of the number of samples in each group minus the number "
"of groups."

"Standard deviations were 2.09 and 2.49 respectively. Are these data "
