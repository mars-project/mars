"Compare two tensors and returns a new array containing the element-wise "
"maxima. If one of the elements being compared is a NaN, then that element"

"latter distinction is important for complex NaNs, which are defined as at"
" least one of the real or imaginary parts being a NaN. The net effect is "
"that NaNs are propagated."
