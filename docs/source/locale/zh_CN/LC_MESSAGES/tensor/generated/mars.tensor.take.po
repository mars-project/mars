"When axis is not None, this function does the same thing as \"fancy\" "
"indexing (indexing arrays using tensors); however, it can be easier to "
"use if you need elements along a given axis. A call such as "
"``mt.take(arr, indices, axis=3)`` is equivalent to "
"``arr[:,:,:,indices,...]``."

#: mars.tensor.take:9 of

"Explained without fancy indexing, this is equivalent to the following use"
" of `ndindex`, which sets each of ``ii``, ``jj``, and ``kk`` to a tuple "

"By eliminating the inner loop in the description above, and using `s_` to"
" build simple slice objects, `take` can be expressed  in terms of "
"applying fancy indexing to each 1-d slice::"

#: mars.tensor.take:65 of

"For this reason, it is equivalent to (but faster than) the following use "

#: mars.tensor.take:84 of
