"The sine is one of the fundamental functions of trigonometry (the "
"mathematical study of triangles).  Consider a circle of radius 1 centered"
" on the origin.  A ray comes in from the :math:`+x` axis, makes an angle "
"at the origin (measured counter-clockwise from that axis), and departs "
"from the origin.  The :math:`y` coordinate of the outgoing ray's "
"intersection with the unit circle is the sine of that angle.  It ranges "
"from -1 for :math:`x=3\\pi / 2` to +1 for :math:`\\pi / 2.`  The function"
" has zeroes where the angle is a multiple of :math:`\\pi`. Sines of "
"angles between :math:`\\pi` and :math:`2\\pi` are negative. The numerous "
"properties of the sine and related functions are included in any standard"
" trigonometry text."
