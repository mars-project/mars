"This function makes most sense for tensors with up to 3 dimensions. For "
"instance, for pixel-data with a height (first axis), width (second axis),"
" and r/g/b channels (third axis). The functions `concatenate`, `stack` "
"and `block` provide more general stacking and concatenation operations."

"stack : Join a sequence of tensors along a new axis. hstack : Stack "
"tensors in sequence horizontally (column wise). dstack : Stack tensors in"

"sequence of tensors along an existing axis. vsplit : Split tensor into a "
"list of multiple sub-arrays vertically. block : Assemble tensors from "
"blocks."
