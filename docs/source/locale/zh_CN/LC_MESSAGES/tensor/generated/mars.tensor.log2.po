"Logarithm is a multivalued function: for each `x` there is an infinite "

"For real-valued input data types, `log2` always returns real output. For "
"each value that cannot be expressed as a real number or infinity, it "
"yields ``nan`` and sets the `invalid` floating point error flag."

"For complex-valued input, `log2` is a complex analytical function that "
"has a branch cut `[-inf, 0]` and is continuous from above on it. `log2` "
"handles the floating-point negative zero as an infinitesimal negative "
"number, conforming to the C99 standard."
