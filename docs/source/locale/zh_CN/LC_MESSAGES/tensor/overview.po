"Mars tensor is the counterpart of Numpy :class:`numpy.ndarray` and "
"implements a subset of the Numpy ndarray interface. It tiles a large "
"tensor into small chunks and describe the inner computation with a "
"directed graph. This lets us compute on tensors larger than memory and "
"take advantage of the ability of multi-cores or distributed clusters."
