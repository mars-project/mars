"Every operand in Mars is scheduled independently by an OperandActor. The "
"execution is designed as a state transition process. We assign a state "
"handling function for every state to control the execution procedure. "
"Every operand is at ``UNSCHEDULED`` state when the actor is initially "
"initialized. When certain conditions are met, the operand switches into "
"another state and perform corresponding actions. If an operand is "
"recovered from KV store, its state when scheduler crashes will be loaded "
"and the state is resumed. The state transition graph can be shown below:"
msgstr ""
"Mars 中的每一个操作符都被一个 OperandActor 单独调度。执行的过程是一个状态"
"转移的过程。在 OperandActor 中，我们为每一个状态的进入过程定义一个状态"
"转移函数。起始 Operand 在初始化时位于 ``READY`` 状态，非起始 Operand 在"
"初始化时则位于 ``UNSCHEDULED`` 状态。当给定的条件满足，Operand 将转移到另"
"一个状态并执行相应的操作。状态转移的流程可以参考下图："

"``RUNNING``: the operand is in this state when it is assigned to a worker"

"``RUNNING``：一个 Operand 位于此状态，当它已被分配 Worker 或者执行已经"
"启动。在进入此状态时，OperandActor 会检查作业是否已经提交。如果尚未提交，"

"``FINISHED``: the operand is in this state when the operand finishes "
"execution. When this state is entered, a terminal operand will send a "
"notification to its GraphActor to decide if the whole graph finishes "
"execution. What's more, the OperandActor looks for precedent and "
"successor chunks and notify them. When a predecessor receives the "
"notification, it checks if all its successors are in ``FINISHED`` state. "
"If so, the data of that operand can be freed.  When a successor receives "
"the notification, it checks if all of its predecessors are finished.  If "
"so, the operand itself can move to ``READY``."

"``FINISHED``：一个 Operand 位于此状态，当作业执行已完成。当 Operand 进入"
"此状态，且 Operand 无后继，一个消息将被发送到 GraphActor 以决定是否整个 "
"Graph 的执行都已结束。与此同时，OperandActor 向它的前驱和后继发送执行完成"
"的消息。如果一个前驱收到此消息，它将检查是否所有的后继都处于 ``FINISHED``"
" 状态。如是，当前 Operand 上的数据可以被释放。如果一个后继收到此消息，它"
