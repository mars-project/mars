"When an operand graph is being executed, proper selection of execution "
"order will reduce total amount of data stored in the cluster, thus "
"reducing the probability that chunks are spilled into disks. Proper "

"transfer in execution."

"Proper execution order can significantly reduce the number of objects "
"stored in the cluster.  We show the example of tree reduction in the "
"graph below, where ovals represent operands and rectangles represent "
"chunks. Red color means that the operand is being executed, and blue "
"color means that the operand is ready for execution. Green color means "
"that the chunk is stored, while the gray color means that chunks or "
"operands are freed. Assume that we have 2 workers, and work load of all "
"operands are the same. Both graphs show one operand selection strategy "
"that is executed after 5 time unit. The left graph show the scenario when"
" nodes are executed in hierarchical order, while the right show that the "
"graph is executed in depth-first order. The strategy on the left graph "
"leaves 6 chunks stored in the cluster, while the right only 2."

"合适的执行顺序能够显著减小集群中暂存的数据总量。下图中展示了 Tree "
"Reduction 的例子，圆形代表 Operand，方形代表 Chunk，红色代表 Operand 正在"
"执行，蓝色代表 Operand 可被执行，绿色代表 Operand 产生的 Chunk 已被存储，"
"灰色代表 Operand 及其相关数据已被释放。假设我们有两台 Worker，并且每个 "
"Operand 的资源使用量均相等，每张图展示的是不同策略下经过5个时间单元的执行"
"后的状态。左图展示的是节点依照层次分别执行，而右图展示的是依照接近深度"
"优先的顺序执行。左图中，有6个 Chunk 的数据需要暂存，右图只有2个。"

"The worker of initial operands are decided when the scheduler prepares an"

"minimal network transfer, a worker satisfying resource requirements are "
"selected."

"Operand 分配 Worker 的依据是输入数据所在的 Worker。如果某个 Worker 拥有的"

"Worker 有多个，则各个候选 Worker 的资源状况将起到决定作用。"
