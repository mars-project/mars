"When a tensor graph is submitted into Mars scheduler, a graph comprises "
"of operands and chunks will be generated given ``chunk_size`` parameters "
"passed in data sources."

"After tiling a tensor graph into a chunk graph, we will combine adjacent "
"nodes to reduce graph size as well as to utilize acceleration libraries "
"such as ``numexpr``. Currently Mars only merges operands that forms a "
"single chain without branches. For example, when executing code"
msgstr ""
"当完成 Chunk 图的生成后，我们将会通过合并图中相邻的节点来减小图的规模，"
"这一合并也能让我们充分利用 ``numexpr`` 这样的加速库来加速计算过程。目前 "
"Mars 仅会合并形成单条链的 Operand。例如，当执行下面的代码"

#: ../../source/distributed/prepare.rst:23
msgid ""
"Mars will compose operand ADD and SUM into one FUSE node. RAND operands "
"are excluded because they don't form a line with ADD and SUM."
msgstr ""
"Mars 将会合并 Operand ADD 和 SUM 成为 FUSE 节点。RAND Operand 不会被合并"
"，因为它们并没有和 ADD 及 SUM 组成一条简单的直线。"

msgid "Initial Worker Assignment"

#: ../../source/distributed/prepare.rst:31
msgid ""
"Assigning operands to workers are crucial to the performance of graph "
"execution. Random worker assignment will contribute to huge network cost "
"and imbalanced workload between different workers. Since the workers of "
"non-initial operands can be effectively decided given data distribution "
"and cluster idleness, we only assign workers for initial nodes in graph "
"preparation stage."
msgstr ""
"为 Operand 分配 Worker 对于图执行的性能而言至关重要。随机分配初始 Operand"
" 可能导致巨大的网络开销，并有可能导致不同 Worker 间作业分配的不平衡。因为"
"非初始节点的分配能够根据其前驱生成数据的物理分布及各个 Worker 的空闲情况"
"方便地确定，在执行图准备阶段，我们只考虑初始 Operand 的分配问题。"

#: ../../source/distributed/prepare.rst:37
msgid ""
"Initial worker assignment should obey several principles. First, the "
"number of operands assigned to each worker should be balanced. This makes"
" full use of the cluster especially in the late stage of graph execution."
" Secondly, operand assignment should minify the amount of network "
"transfer in its descendants. That is, locality need to be observed in the"
" assignment process."
msgstr ""
"初始 Worker 分配需要遵循几个准则。首先，分配给每个 Worker 执行的 Operand "
"需要尽量保持平衡，这能够使计算集群在整个执行阶段都有较高的利用率，这在"
"执行的最后阶段显得尤其重要。其次，初始节点分配需要使后续节点执行时的网络"
"\"传输尽量小。也就是说，初始点分配需要充分遵循局部性原则。"

#: ../../source/distributed/prepare.rst:43
msgid ""
"Note that these principles sometimes collides with each other. That is, a"
" network-minimal solution may be quite biased. We developed a heuristic "
"algorithm in practice that takes a balance between minimal network "
"transfer and worker load balance. The algorithm is described below:"
msgstr ""
"需要注意的是，上述准则在某些情况下会彼此冲突。一个网络传输量最小的分配"
"方案可能会非常偏斜。我们开发了一套启发式算法来获取两个目标的平衡，该算法"
