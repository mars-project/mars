"Calculates ``log2(2**x1 + 2**x2)``. This function is useful in machine "
"learning when the calculated probabilities of events may be so small as "
"to exceed the range of normal floating point numbers.  In such cases the "
"base-2 logarithm of the calculated probability can be used instead. This "
"function allows adding probabilities stored in such a fashion."
