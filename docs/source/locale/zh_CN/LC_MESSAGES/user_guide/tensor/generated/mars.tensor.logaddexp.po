"Calculates ``log(exp(x1) + exp(x2))``. This function is useful in "
"statistics where the calculated probabilities of events may be so small "
"as to exceed the range of normal floating point numbers.  In such cases "
"the logarithm of the calculated probability is stored. This function "
"allows adding probabilities stored in such a fashion."
