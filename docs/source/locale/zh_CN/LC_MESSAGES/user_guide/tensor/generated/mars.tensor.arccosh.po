"`arccosh` is a multivalued function: for each `x` there are infinitely "
"many numbers `z` such that `cosh(z) = x`. The convention is to return the"
" `z` whose imaginary part lies in `[-pi, pi]` and the real part in ``[0, "
"inf]``."

#: mars.tensor.arccosh:27 of

"For real-valued input data types, `arccosh` always returns real output. "
"For each value that cannot be expressed as a real number or infinity, it "
"yields ``nan`` and sets the `invalid` floating point error flag."

"For complex-valued input, `arccosh` is a complex analytical function that"
" has a branch cut `[-inf, 1]` and is continuous from above on it."
