"`arcsin` is a multivalued function: for each `x` there are infinitely "
"many numbers `z` such that :math:`sin(z) = x`.  The convention is to "
"return the angle `z` whose real part lies in [-pi/2, pi/2]."

"For real-valued input data types, *arcsin* always returns real output. "
"For each value that cannot be expressed as a real number or infinity, it "
"yields ``nan`` and sets the `invalid` floating point error flag."

"For complex-valued input, `arcsin` is a complex analytic function that "
"has, by convention, the branch cuts [-inf, -1] and [1, inf]  and is "
"continuous from above on the former and from below on the latter."
