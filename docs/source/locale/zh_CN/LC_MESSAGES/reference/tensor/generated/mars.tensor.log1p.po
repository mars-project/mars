"Logarithm is a multivalued function: for each `x` there is an infinite "
"number of `z` such that `exp(z) = 1 + x`. The convention is to return the"
" `z` whose imaginary part lies in `[-pi, pi]`."

"For real-valued input data types, `log1p` always returns real output. For"
" each value that cannot be expressed as a real number or infinity, it "
"yields ``nan`` and sets the `invalid` floating point error flag."

"For complex-valued input, `log1p` is a complex analytical function that "
"has a branch cut `[-inf, -1]` and is continuous from above on it. `log1p`"
" handles the floating-point negative zero as an infinitesimal negative "
"number, conforming to the C99 standard."
