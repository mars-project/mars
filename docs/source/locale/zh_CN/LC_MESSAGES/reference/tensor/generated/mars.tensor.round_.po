"For values exactly halfway between rounded decimal values, NumPy rounds "
"to the nearest even value. Thus 1.5 and 2.5 round to 2.0, -0.5 and 0.5 "
"round to 0.0, etc. Results may also be surprising due to the inexact "
"representation of decimal fractions in the IEEE floating point standard "
"[1]_ and errors introduced when scaling by powers of ten."
