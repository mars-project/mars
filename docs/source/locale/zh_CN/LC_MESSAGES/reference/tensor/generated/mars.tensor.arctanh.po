"`arctanh` is a multivalued function: for each `x` there are infinitely "
"many numbers `z` such that `tanh(z) = x`. The convention is to return the"
" `z` whose imaginary part lies in `[-pi/2, pi/2]`."

"For real-valued input data types, `arctanh` always returns real output. "
"For each value that cannot be expressed as a real number or infinity, it "
"yields ``nan`` and sets the `invalid` floating point error flag."

"For complex-valued input, `arctanh` is a complex analytical function that"
" has branch cuts `[-1, -inf]` and `[1, inf]` and is continuous from above"
" on the former and from below on the latter."
