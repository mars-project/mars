"The variance is the average of the squared deviations from the mean, "

#: mars.tensor.nanvar:59 of

"The mean is normally calculated as ``x.sum() / N``, where ``N = len(x)``."
" If, however, `ddof` is specified, the divisor ``N - ddof`` is used "
"instead.  In standard statistical practice, ``ddof=1`` provides an "
"unbiased estimator of the variance of a hypothetical infinite population."
"  ``ddof=0`` provides a maximum likelihood estimate of the variance for "
"normally distributed variables."

"Note that for complex numbers, the absolute value is taken before "
"squaring, so that the result is always real and nonnegative."

#: mars.tensor.nanvar:69 of

"For floating-point input, the variance is computed using the same "
"precision the input has.  Depending on the input data, this can cause the"
" results to be inaccurate, especially for `float32` (see example below)."
"  Specifying a higher-accuracy accumulator using the ``dtype`` keyword "
"can alleviate this issue."
