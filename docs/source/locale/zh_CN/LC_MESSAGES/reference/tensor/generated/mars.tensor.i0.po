"We use the algorithm published by Clenshaw [1]_ and referenced by "
"Abramowitz and Stegun [2]_, for which the function domain is partitioned "
"into the two intervals [0,8] and (8,inf), and Chebyshev polynomial "
"expansions are employed in each interval. Relative error on the domain "

"5.8e-16 with an rms of 1.4e-16 (n = 30000)."
