"The word \"non-zero\" is in reference to the Python 2.x built-in method "
"``__nonzero__()`` (renamed ``__bool__()`` in Python 3.x) of Python "
"objects that tests an object's \"truthfulness\". For example, any number "
"is considered truthful if it is nonzero, whereas any string is considered"
" truthful if it is not the empty string. Thus, this function "
"(recursively) counts how many elements in ``a`` (and in sub-tensors "
"thereof) have their ``__nonzero__()`` or ``__bool__()`` method evaluated "
"to ``True``."
