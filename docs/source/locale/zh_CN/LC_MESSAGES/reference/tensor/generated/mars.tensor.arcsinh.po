"`arcsinh` is a multivalued function: for each `x` there are infinitely "
"many numbers `z` such that `sinh(z) = x`. The convention is to return the"
" `z` whose imaginary part lies in `[-pi/2, pi/2]`."

"For real-valued input data types, `arcsinh` always returns real output. "
"For each value that cannot be expressed as a real number or infinity, it "
"returns ``nan`` and sets the `invalid` floating point error flag."

"For complex-valued input, `arccos` is a complex analytical function that "
"has branch cuts `[1j, infj]` and `[-1j, -infj]` and is continuous from "
"the right on the former and from the left on the latter."
