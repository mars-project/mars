"Logarithm is a multivalued function: for each `x` there is an infinite "
"number of `z` such that `exp(z) = x`. The convention is to return the `z`"
" whose imaginary part lies in `[-pi, pi]`."

#: mars.tensor.log:30 of

"For real-valued input data types, `log` always returns real output. For "
"each value that cannot be expressed as a real number or infinity, it "
"yields ``nan`` and sets the `invalid` floating point error flag."
msgstr ""

#: mars.tensor.log:34 of
msgid ""
"For complex-valued input, `log` is a complex analytical function that has"
" a branch cut `[-inf, 0]` and is continuous from above on it. `log` "
"handles the floating-point negative zero as an infinitesimal negative "
"number, conforming to the C99 standard."
