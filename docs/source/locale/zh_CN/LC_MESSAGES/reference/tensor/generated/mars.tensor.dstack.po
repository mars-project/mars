"This is equivalent to concatenation along the third axis after 2-D "
"tensors of shape `(M,N)` have been reshaped to `(M,N,1)` and 1-D arrays "
"of shape `(N,)` have been reshaped to `(1,N,1)`. Rebuilds arrays divided "
"by `dsplit`."

"This function makes most sense for arrays with up to 3 dimensions. For "
"instance, for pixel-data with a height (first axis), width (second axis),"
" and r/g/b channels (third axis). The functions `concatenate`, `stack` "
"and `block` provide more general stacking and concatenation operations."
