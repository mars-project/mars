"Indicating whether the intervals include the right or the left bin edge. "
"Default behavior is (right==False) indicating that the interval does not "

"If values in `x` are such that they fall outside the bin range, "
"attempting to index `bins` with the indices that `digitize` returns will "
"result in an IndexError."

#: mars.tensor.digitize:36 of
msgid ""
"`mt.digitize` is  implemented in terms of `mt.searchsorted`. This means "
"that a binary search is used to bin the values, which scales much better "
"for larger number of bins than the previous linear search. It also "
"removes the requirement for the input array to be 1-dimensional."
