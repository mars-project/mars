*************************
Integrate with TensorFlow
*************************

.. currentmodule:: mars.learn.contrib.tensorflow

This introduction will give a brief tour about how to integrate `TensorFlow
<https://www.tensorflow.org>`_ in Mars.

This tutorial is based on TensorFlow 2.0.

Installation
------------

If you are trying to use Mars on a single machine, e.g. on your laptop, make
sure TensorFlow is installed.

You can install TensorFlow via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install tensorflow

Visit `installation guide for TensorFlow <https://www.tensorflow.org/install>`_
for more information.

On the other hand, if you are about to use Mars on a cluster, maker sure
TensorFlow is installed on each worker.

Prepare data
------------

The dataset here we used is `ionosphere dataset
<http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/ionosphere/>`_, click
link to download data.

Prepare TensorFlow script
-------------------------

Now we create a Python file called ``tf_demo.py`` which contains the logic of
TensorFlow.

.. code-block:: python

    import os

    import mars.dataframe as md
    import tensorflow as tf
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
    from tensorflow.keras import Sequential
    from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense


    def prepare_data():
        df = md.read_csv('ionosphere.data', header=None)

        # split into input and output columns
        X = df.iloc[:, :-1].to_tensor().astype('float32')
        y = df.iloc[:, -1].to_tensor()

        # convert Mars tensor to numpy ndarray
        X, y = X.to_numpy(), y.to_numpy()

        # encode string to integer
        y = LabelEncoder().fit_transform(y)

        # split into train and test datasets
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.33)
        print(X_train.size, X_test.size, y_train.size, y_test.size)

        return X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test


    def get_model(n_features):
        model = Sequential()
        model.add(Dense(10, activation='relu', kernel_initializer='he_normal',
                        input_shape=(n_features,)))
        model.add(Dense(8, activation='relu', kernel_initializer='he_normal'))
        model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

        # compile the model
        model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

        return model


    def train():
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = prepare_data()

        model = get_model(X_train.shape[1])

        # fit model
        model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=150, batch_size=32, verbose=0)
        # evaluate
        loss, acc = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)
        print('Test accuracy: %.3f' % acc)


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        if 'TF_CONFIG' in os.environ:
            # distributed TensorFlow
            multiworker_strategy = tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy()

            with multiworker_strategy.scope():
                train()
        else:
            train()

Mars libraries including DataFrame and so forth could be used directly to
process massive data and accelerate preprocess.

Run TensorFlow script via Mars
------------------------------

The TensorFlow script can be submitted via :meth:`run_tensorflow_script` now.

.. code-block:: ipython

Distributed training or inference
---------------------------------

Refer to :ref:`deploy` section for deployment, or :ref:`k8s` section for
running Mars on Kubernetes.

As you can tell from ``tf_demo.py``, Mars will set environment variable
``TF_CONFIG`` automatically.  ``TF_CONFIG`` contains cluster and task
information.  Thus you don't need to worry about the distributed setting, what
you need do is to choose a proper `distributed strategy
<https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/distributed_training#types_of_strategies>`_.

Once a cluster exists, you can either set the session as default, the training
and prediction shown above will be submitted to the cluster, or you can specify
``session=***`` explicitly as well.

.. code-block:: python

   # A cluster has been configured, and web UI is started on <web_ip>:<web_port>
   import mars
   # set the session as the default one
   sess = mars.new_session('http://<web_ip>:<web_port>')

   # submitted to cluster by default
   run_tensorflow_script('tf_demo.py', n_workers=1)

   # Or, session could be specified as well
   run_tensorflow_script('tf_demo.py', n_workers=1, session=sess)
